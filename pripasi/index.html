    I want to inform you that whenever you
    use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
    I collect data and information (through third party
    products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
    include information such as your device Internet Protocol
    (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
    configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
    the time and date of your use of the Service, and other

    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
    commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
    to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
    stored on your device's internal memory.
</p> <p>
    This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
    the app may use third party code and libraries that use
    “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
    You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
    and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you

    individuals due to the following reasons:
</p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
    I want to inform users of this Service
    that these third parties have access to your Personal
    Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
    them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
    disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
</p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
    I value your trust in providing us your
    Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
    acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
    of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
    storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
    guarantee its absolute security.

    a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
    that these external sites are not operated by me.
    Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
    Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
    no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
    privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
    services.
</p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <p>
    These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
    I do not knowingly collect personally
    identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
    me with personal information, I immediately
    delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
    and you are aware that your child has provided us with
    personal information, please contact me so that
    I will be able to do necessary actions.

    periodically for any changes. I will
